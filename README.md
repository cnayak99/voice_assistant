# Voice Assistant

A React Native application that uses AssemblyAI for real-time transcription, Groq AI for generating responses, and ElevenLabs for text-to-speech.

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
npm install react-native-sound react-native-fs
```

2. Set up your API keys:
   - Copy `config.template.ts` to `config.ts`
   - Open `config.ts` and replace the placeholder API keys with your actual keys:
     - `ASSEMBLYAI_API_KEY`: Get a free key from [AssemblyAI Dashboard](https://www.assemblyai.com/dashboard/signup)
     - `GROQ_API_KEY`: Get your API key from [Groq](https://console.groq.com/keys)
     - `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY`: Get your API key from [ElevenLabs](https://elevenlabs.io/app/account)

3. Link native dependencies:
```bash
npx react-native link react-native-sound
npx react-native link react-native-fs
```

## Running the Application for Debugging

To effectively debug this application, you'll need to run three terminals:

### Terminal 1: Metro Bundler
```bash
npx react-native start
```
This starts the Metro bundler which compiles your JavaScript code and serves it to your device.

### Terminal 2: Android
```bash
npx react-native run-android
```
This builds and installs the Android app on your connected device or emulator.

### Terminal 3: iOS (if on macOS)
```bash
npx react-native run-ios
```
This builds and installs the iOS app on your simulator or connected device.

If you're on Windows, you can only run the Android version. For additional debugging logs, use:
```bash
npx react-native log-android
```

## Features

- Real-time speech-to-text using AssemblyAI
- AI responses generated by Groq AI
- Text-to-speech using ElevenLabs
- Simple UI for conversation display

## How It Works

1. The app captures audio from the device microphone
2. Audio is streamed to AssemblyAI for real-time transcription
3. Final transcripts are sent to Groq AI for generating responses
4. Responses are sent to ElevenLabs for text-to-speech conversion
5. Audio is played back to the user
6. The conversation is displayed in a chat-like interface

## Troubleshooting

- If you encounter permission issues, ensure microphone permissions are granted
- Check the console logs for detailed error messages
- Verify your API keys are correctly set in `config.ts`
- If audio playback isn't working, make sure the device volume is turned up

# Getting Started

> **Note**: Make sure you have completed the [Set Up Your Environment](https://reactnative.dev/docs/set-up-your-environment) guide before proceeding.

## Step 1: Start Metro

First, you will need to run **Metro**, the JavaScript build tool for React Native.

To start the Metro dev server, run the following command from the root of your React Native project:

```sh
# Using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Build and run your app

With Metro running, open a new terminal window/pane from the root of your React Native project, and use one of the following commands to build and run your Android or iOS app:

### Android

```sh
# Using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### iOS

For iOS, remember to install CocoaPods dependencies (this only needs to be run on first clone or after updating native deps).

The first time you create a new project, run the Ruby bundler to install CocoaPods itself:

```sh
bundle install
```

Then, and every time you update your native dependencies, run:

```sh
bundle exec pod install
```

For more information, please visit [CocoaPods Getting Started guide](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html).

```sh
# Using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up correctly, you should see your new app running in the Android Emulator, iOS Simulator, or your connected device.

This is one way to run your app — you can also build it directly from Android Studio or Xcode.

## Step 3: Modify your app

Now that you have successfully run the app, let's make changes!

Open `App.tsx` in your text editor of choice and make some changes. When you save, your app will automatically update and reflect these changes — this is powered by [Fast Refresh](https://reactnative.dev/docs/fast-refresh).

When you want to forcefully reload, for example to reset the state of your app, you can perform a full reload:

- **Android**: Press the <kbd>R</kbd> key twice or select **"Reload"** from the **Dev Menu**, accessed via <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (Windows/Linux) or <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (macOS).
- **iOS**: Press <kbd>R</kbd> in iOS Simulator.

## Congratulations! :tada:

You've successfully run and modified your React Native App. :partying_face:
